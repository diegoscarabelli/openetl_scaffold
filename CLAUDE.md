# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## README.md

The most important source of truth is the [`/README.md`](README.md) file. You MUST read and understand the `README.md` file in order to provide accurate and relevant responses and coding assistance.

The `README.md` file includes:
- **Introduction**: Project overview, clone-and-detach workflow, and key characteristics.
- **Getting Started**: Clone, credentials, database setup (database.ddl, schemas.ddl, iam.sql), Python environment, and test suite verification.
- **Running Pipelines**: Configuration tips for Airflow (Astro CLI) and Prefect adapters.
- **Database Environments**: Production and development database setup and switching.
- **Standard Pipeline**: Five-step pipeline sequence, ETLConfig, and example DAG/flow entry points.
- **Data Directories**: Four-directory file state machine (ingest, process, store, quarantine).
- **Repository Structure**: Detailed reference for `dags/lib/`, `dags/pipelines/`, DDL files, and tests.

## CONTRIBUTING.md

The [`/CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file contains development guidelines and code quality standards. You MUST follow these guidelines when writing or modifying code.
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file includes:
- **How to Contribute**: Setup, bug reports, feature requests, PR checklist.
- **Formatting**: Python formatting with Black, Autoflake, and Docformatter. SQL formatting with SQLFluff. Pre-commit hooks and make targets.
- **Testing**: Requirements for tests, coverage expectations, and how to run tests.
- **Documentation**: Guidelines for updating documentation when making changes.
- **Code Review Process**: How PRs are reviewed and merged.

## Code Execution Environment

Development dependencies are managed via a `.venv` virtual environment created by the Makefile:

```bash
make venv
```

This installs everything in [`requirements_dev.txt`](requirements_dev.txt).

### Command Reference

- **Create/update venv**: `make venv`
- **Format code**: `make format`
- **Check formatting**: `make check-format`
- **Run tests**: `make test`

## MANDATORY Formatting Protocol

When ANY formatting request is made (explicit or implicit), you MUST:

### Step 1: Manual Quality Review (BEFORE make format)
Execute EVERY item from CONTRIBUTING.md Quality Checklist:

- [ ] Module docstring present
- [ ] Imports properly organized and sorted, no unused imports
- [ ] All functions have type hints
- [ ] All docstrings use `:param` and `:return` format
- [ ] **MANUALLY CHECK: Proper spacing and blank lines throughout file**
- [ ] Black-compliant format
- [ ] **MANUALLY CHECK: No trailing whitespace**
- [ ] Consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- [ ] **MANUALLY CHECK: Periods at the end of ALL sentences** (comments, docstrings, bullet lists, log messages)
- [ ] **MANUALLY CHECK: No line longer than 88 characters**

### Step 2: Apply Automated Tools
- [ ] Run `make format`
- [ ] Run `make check-format` to validate

### Step 3: Final Manual Verification
- [ ] Verify final newline at end of file
- [ ] Double-check line lengths and periods were properly applied

### CRITICAL: Manual Checks Required
The following items are NOT caught by automated tools and MUST be manually verified:
1. **Line length**: Check every line is 88 characters or less.
2. **Periods**: Every comment, docstring sentence, log message ends with period.
3. **Spacing**: Proper blank lines between logical sections.
4. **File ending**: Final newline present.

## Formatting Trigger Words

When you encounter ANY of these words/phrases, immediately execute the complete formatting protocol:
- "formatting"
- "format"
- "quality check"
- "style"
- "apply formatting guidelines"
- "according to guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md"
- "quality checklist"
- When completing ANY code file creation/modification

NEVER use `make format` alone: always execute the complete manual + automated protocol.

## Quality Checklist Command Reference

Before ANY file completion, run this mental checklist:
1. **Read current file**: identify all issues manually.
2. **Line length check**: scan for any line exceeding 88 characters.
3. **Period check**: ensure all comments, docstrings, and log messages end with periods.
4. **Spacing check**: verify proper spacing between sections and imports.
5. **Apply automated tools**: run `make format` and `make check-format`.
6. **Final verification**: confirm all quality standards are met.

## Code Completion Protocol Enforcement

**MANDATORY**: Before marking any code task as complete:
1. Execute complete manual quality review (Steps 1-3 above).
2. Run `make format` followed by `make check-format`.
3. Verify zero formatting violations.
4. Only then proceed with task completion.

**VIOLATION HANDLING**: If you discover you missed manual checks:
1. Immediately acknowledge the oversight.
2. Execute the complete formatting protocol.
3. Document what was missed to prevent recurrence.
